# Insertion Sort
Sort an array using insertion sort.

## Challenge
Write a function for insertion sort that takes in an unsorted array and returns the array sorted using insertion sort.

## Approach & Efficiency
I used a nested for loop which has a time of O(n2) but because I am only moving one element at a time this method has a space of O(1).
