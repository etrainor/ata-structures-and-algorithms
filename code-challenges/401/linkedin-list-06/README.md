# Linked List Insertions
Use linked list functionality to do stuff.

## Challenge
Add 2 methods (insertBefore() and insertAfter() to a linked list Class. Append was demonstrated in class.

## Approach & Efficiency
Traversed a linked list using required methods. We think that Big O is O(n) because more time would be consumed based on the number of nodes.
